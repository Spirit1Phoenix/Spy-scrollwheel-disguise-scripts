# Spy-scrollwheel-disguise-scripts
Just a scroll wheel disguise script that I made

This Script calls upon multiple files in order to let you know what class you are disguising as, all of which should be provided in this repo

WARNING: THIS SCRIPT WILL SPAM YOUR CONSOLE. IT CAN BE DISABLED THOUGH IF YOU DO NOT WANT THAT. Instructions on how to disable are in spyscroll.cfg

TO INSTALL

Just download all the files and drop them in your tf/cfg folder, and then add in this line to your spy config file.

"exec spyscroll"
